        <p class="intro">Hello, I am Seth Glover. I live in Denver. I play disc golf as a hobby.</p>
        <p>City traffic can be a pain. <span class="sentence"> You get used to it.</span> I love my job.</p>
        <p>Driving to and from a great office is nice. Not having to do it 5 days a week is better. The coffee machine is amazing.</p>
        <p>I also paint. I use oil paint. I have been writing and viewing HTML regularly for over a decade.</p>
